<h1>Pacman Demo</hi>

<h2>Description</h2>

This demo was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.

For this demo, I used existing images and adapted some provided code in order to animate Pacman to travel from one side of the screen to the other, flipping directions within the boundaries. Pacman opens and closes his mouth as he moves, though this was provided code. 

<h2>Support</h2>

For help with this demo, please contact regan.kirk@gmail.com.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

Down the line, I hope to develop this code to be more sophisticated, allowing the user additional interaction with Pacman, as in the game.
